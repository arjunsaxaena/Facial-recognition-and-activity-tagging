# Face recognition and Activity Tagging

Two python files one for registering user and his/her facial embeddings, and the second one for real time face recognition from existing user embeddings stored.

Used opencv=4.10.0.84 and dlib=19.24.6 for the project and shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file downloaded from https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition.git
and dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat file which was downloaded from https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models.git. Suitable comments are added in the code.
